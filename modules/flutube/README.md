# FluTube

Embed Youtube videos in your flutter apps just by passing in the video URL!

PLEASE NOTE: Embedding copyrighted videos is actually not possible. Please use [flutter_youtube](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/flutter_youtube) instead.

This plugin uses an in-built API so the official YT API is not used here and therefore you don't need any API keys.

This plugin also uses the great plugin [Chewie](https://github.com/brianegan/chewie) to provide a nice material or cupertino video player. And please note this plugin is NOT a replacement for Chewie. Chewie is a great plugin and here we are just using it.

Huge thank you to [@brianegan](https://github.com/brianegan) for developing Chewie.
